       <p><blockquote>“Hymir prided himself on his skills at fishing. "I am an excellent fisherman," he said. "We can catch tomorrow night's dinner."
        "I too am a fine fisherman," said Thor. He had never fished before, but how hard could it be?
        We'll meet tomorrow at dawn, out on the dock," said Hymir.
        In their huge bedroom that night, Tyr said to Thor, "I hope you know what you are doing."
        "Of course I do," said Thor. But he didn't. He was just doing whatever he felt like doing. That was what Thor did best.”</blockquote></p><p id="author">Neil Gaiman, Norse Mythology</p>
